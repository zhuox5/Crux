# Crux compiler is a program constructed from a fairly small imperative programming language into executable x86 assembly. It follows a traditional compiler design approach of partitioning our compiler into a sequence of stages, starting with a frontend and proceeding toward a backend in incremental steps. These stages will transform the input source code progressively into executable output.
